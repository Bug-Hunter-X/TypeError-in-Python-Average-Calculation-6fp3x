This repository demonstrates a common Python error and its solution. The `bug.py` file contains code that raises a `TypeError` when calculating the average of a list containing non-numeric elements. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a robust solution that handles this error gracefully.  The error arises from attempting mathematical operations (sum and division) on a list containing strings.
